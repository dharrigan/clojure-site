ClojureBridge is a fun, free and friendly workshop for trans/cis women and
non-binary people. The workshop is suitable for people just starting to code,
or people on their first language who are also Clojure curious.

On the Friday evening we have members of the community sharing their
development experiences and show what you can do with Clojure. We also help
you install Clojure development tools (optional).

On Saturday we coach you through a day of small practical exercises, building
responsive websites or creating simple games. We aim for 1-2-1 coaching so we
can support you each step of the way.

The event is free of charge and run by unpaid volunteers from the Clojure
community. While the workshop is primarily for trans/cis women & non-binary
attendees, our coaches and organisers are members of the local Clojure
community of any gender or none. Everyone agrees to abide by the ClojureBridge
Code of Conduct.
